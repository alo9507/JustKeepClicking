I've never made an open source contribution. After reading Eric Raymond's The Cathedral and the Bazaar, I felt the time had come to break the seal. Here's how I started.

<h2>Step 1: First Contributions</h2>

Github: [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)

This repo is as easy as it gets to try a risk-free, judgement-free first open source commit.

Your task: add yourself to the CONTRIBUTORS.md.

Since you dont have write-access to this repository, you'll learn how the Open Source contribution flow:

Fork -> Clone -> Modify -> PR your forked branch to base repository master

differs from full write-access contribution flow you're may be familiar with from work:

Branch -> Modify -> PR into master

Forking rather than branching also keeps the base repository from becoming to cluttered with experimental branches.

Good lesson. But I wanted to make a slightly larger contribution, something that would require actually pulling down and running a JavaScript or iOS project.

<h2>Step 2: Search for Low Hanging Fruit</h2>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I think it would be cool to give several hours each month to your team to heavily encourage your developers to search for an open source project to contribute to. ANY Open Source project.

The medium is the message here. The content is secondary to cracking the seal on giving back to an ecosystem and social economy that has given the world so much.
