From Di-lemma to Tetra-lemma Thinking


Disclaimer: This article contains generalizations about the mental paradigms of entire hemispheres. Please interpret charitably.

In the historically Christian-rooted West, much is boiled down to dichotomies: heaven or hell, left or right, saved or unsaved.

This is di-lemma thinking, with the Greek roots of di meaning twice, lemma meaning premise.

Basically, di-lemma (or di-chotomous) thinking is thinking cut in two.

Di-lemma thinking covers only half of the logical playing field on which we assess new ideas and opinions.

Contrast di-lemma thinking with the predominant logical paradigm of ancient India - a tetra-lemma (four-lemma) system.

Under the di-lemma paradigm, matters can be abstracted down to the two premises:
1. Things are black
2. Things are white

Under the tetra-lemma paradigm, matters are instead abstracted down to the four premises:
1. Things are black
2. Things are white
3. Things are both black and white (gray)
4. Things are neither black nor white (transparent)

For the curious in symbolic logic this looks like this

Tetralemma thinking wasn’t just some logical framework for the literati. It was very much at the forefront of Indian theology and even daily life.

Look at this question a prospective monk asked of the Buddha in the []:

Does a Tathagata [one who has reached full awakening] come to an end? (black)
Does a Tathagata not come to an end? (white)
Does a Tathagata come to an end and not come to an end? (black and white)
Does a Tathagata neither come to an end nor not come to an end? (transparent)

It’s hard to imagine such a question being put to Jesus or Mohammad. This monk’s concern on the afterlife of a Tathagata was clearly spawned from his tetralemma based worldview.

Ancient Hinduism and Buddhism, like many other eastern traditions like Daoism, search for meaning not just in the spaces in between places, but also in the spaces beyond either of those spaces under consideration.

The more I’ve applied tetra-lemma thinking to my own life, encountering situations as disparate as software engineering design (should i make it this way? Or that way? Or neither of those ways?) to relationships (Does this person like me? Do they not like me?), I’ve found greater mental flexibility.
